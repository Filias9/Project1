# Git Essentials

Building web applications can be tough, but we sometimes make it tougher than it needs to be. If you’ve ever tried to fix bugs in one part of a file, while keeping track of a new feature in another part of the file, you know what I’m talking about!

You’ll never have to worry about overwriting stable code or losing track of your bugs again! In this course, I’ll teach you everything you need to know to start using Git in your daily development workflow.
